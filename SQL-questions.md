**3.List students who are from Kenya.**



**4.Display students with Age less than 25.**



**5.Show the fNAME, lNAME, and studyHOUi of all students.**



#### ğŸ“— Medium-Level (Using GROUP BY, HAVING, Subqueries, CASE)



**1.Show the average Python score for each country, but only include countries with more than 3 students.**



**2.Find the students who have the maximum DB score in each country.**



**3.Display students with their Grade based on Python score:**



**â‰¥ 85 â†’ 'A'**



**70â€“84 â†’ 'B'**



**50â€“69 â†’ 'C'**



**Else â†’ 'D'**



**4.Find all students whose studyHOUi is greater than the average studyHOUi for their country.**



**5.Count how many students have the same prevEduca (Diploma, Bachelors, etc.), sorted in descending order.**

#### 

#### ğŸ“™ Hard-Level (Using Window Functions, CTEs, Nested Queries, Joins)

#### 

**1.Use a window function to rank students by Python score within each country.**



**2.Write a query to show the top 2 students from each country based on DB score.**



**3.Find the student(s) who have the second highest studyHOUi overall.**



**4.Using a CTE, calculate the average Python and DB scores, then list students who scored higher than both averages.**



**5.Show the difference between each studentâ€™s studyHOUi and their countryâ€™s average studyHOUi (use window function).**



**6.Find the youngest student(s) in each residence type.**



**7.Use a subquery in SELECT to display each studentâ€™s Python score along with the average Python score of all students.**



**8.Show the percentage contribution of each studentâ€™s DB score to the total DB scores (use window function).**



**9.List students who are in the top 10% of Python scores (use window function + NTILE or percentile).**



**10.Create a query that shows for each student:**



**.fNAME, lNAME, Python, DB**



**.A column that says 'Better in Python' if Python > DB, else 'Better in DB'.**
